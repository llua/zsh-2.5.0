X.SH PARAMETERS
XA parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.
XA name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
Xcharacters and _'s, or the single characters
X*, @, #, ?, \-, $, or !.
XThe value may be either a \fIscalar\fP (a string),
Xan integer, or an array.
XTo assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter,
Xuse the \fBtypeset\fP builtin.
XTo assign an array value, use \fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP \fIvalue\fP ....
XThe value of a parameter may also be assigned by writing:
X.RS
X.PP
X\fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP ...
X.RE
X.PP
XIf the integer attribute, \-\fBi\fP, is set for \fIname\fP,
Xthe \fIvalue\fP is subject to arithmetic evaluation.
X.PP
XThe value of an array parameter may be assigned by writing:
X.RS
X.PP
X\fIname\fP=(\fIvalue\fP ...) ...
X.RE
XIndividual elements of an array may be selected using a 
Xsubscript.  A subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp\fB]\fR
Xselects the single element \fIexp\fP, where \fIexp\fP is
Xan arithmetic expression which will be subject to arithmetic
Xexpansion as if it were surrounded by "$[...]".  
XThe elements are numbered beginning with 1.
XA subscript of the form \fB[*]\fP or \fB[@]\fP evaluates to all
Xelements of an array; there is no difference between the two
Xexcept when they appear within double quotes.
X"$foo[*]" evaluates to "$foo[1] $foo[2] ...", while
X"$foo[@]" evaluates to "$foo[1]" "$foo[2]", etc.
XA subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp1\fP,\fIexp2\fB]\fR
Xselects all elements in the range \fIexp1\fP to \fIexp2\fP,
Xinclusive.
XIf one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number,
Xsay \-\fIn\fP, then the \fIn\fPth element from the end
Xof the array is used.  Thus "$foo[-3]" is the third element
Xfrom the end of the array \fIfoo\fP, and
X"$foo[1,-1]" is the same as "$foo[*]".
X.PP
XSubscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which
Xcase the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted.
XFor example, if \fBFOO\fP is set to \fBfoobar\fP, then
X\fBecho $FOO[2,5]\fP prints \fBooba\fP.
X.PP
XIf a subscript is used on the left side of an assignment the selected
Xrange is replaced by the expression on the right side.
X.PP
XIf the opening bracket or the comma is directly followed by an opening
Xparentheses the string up to the matching closing one is considered to
Xbe a list of flags. The flags currently understood are:
X.PP
X.RS
X.PD
X.TP
X.B e
Xthe argument is expanded using full shell expansion first
X.TP
X.B w
Xif the parameter subscripted is a scalar than this flag makes
Xsubscription work on a per-word basis instead of characters
X.TP
X.B s:\fIstring\fB:
Xthis gives the \fIstring\fP that separates words (for use with the
X\fBw\fP flag)
X.TP
X.B r
Xif this flag is given the \fIexp\fP is taken as a pattern and the
Xresult is the first matching array element, substring or word (if the
Xparameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a scalar and the
X\fBw\fP flag is given, respectively); note that this is like giving a
Xnumber: \fB$foo[(r)??,3]\fP and \fB$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]\fP work
X.TP
X.B R
Xlike \fBr\fP, but gives the last match
X.TP
X.B i
Xlike \fBr\fP, but gives the index of the match instead; this may not
Xbe combined with a second argument
X.TP
X.B I
Xlike \fBi\fP, but gives the index of the last match
X.TP
X.B n:\fIexpr\fB:
Xif combined with \fBr\fP, \fBR\fP, \fI\fP, or \fBI\fP, makes them give
Xthe \fIn\fP'th or \fIn\fP'th last match (if \fIexpr\fP evaluates to
X\fIn\fP)
X.PD
X.RE
X.SS Positional Parameters
XPositional parameters are set by the shell on invocation,
Xby the \fBset\fP builtin, or by direct assignment.
XThe parameter \fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a number,
Xis the \fIn\fPth positional parameter.
XThe parameters \fB*\fP, \fB@\fP, and \fBargv\fP are
Xarrays containing all the positional parameters;
Xthus \fBargv\fP[\fIn\fP], etc. is equivalent to simply \fIn\fP.

X.TP
X.B BAUD
XThe baud rate of the current connection.  Used by the line editor
Xupdate mechanism to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying
Xupdates until necessary.  This may be profitably set to a lower value
Xin some circumstances, e.g.
Xfor slow modems dialing into a communications server which is connected
Xto a host via a fast link; in this case, this variable
Xwould be set by default to the speed of the fast link, and not
Xthe modem.
XThis parameter should be set to the baud
Xrate of the slowest part of the link for best performance. The compensation
Xmechanism can be turned off by setting the variable to zero.
X.TP
X.B cdpath (CDPATH)
XAn array (colon-separated list)
Xof directories specifying the search path for the \fBcd\fP command.
X.TP
X.B COLUMNS

Xfile is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment.
X.TP
X.B HISTCHARS
XThree characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis
Xmechanism.  The first character signals the start of a history
Xsubstitution (default `!').  The second character signals the
Xstart of a quick history substitution (default `^').  The third
Xcharacter is the comment character (default `#').
X.TP
X.B HISTFILE
XThe file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.
XIf unset, the history is not saved.
X.TP
X.B HISTSIZE
XThe maximum size of the history list.
X.TP
X.B HOME
XThe default argument for the \fBcd\fP command.
X.TP
X.B IFS
XInternal field separators, normally space, tab, and newline, that
Xare used to separate words which result from
Xcommand or parameter substitution and words read by
Xthe \fBread\fP builtin.
X.TP
X.B KEYTIMEOUT
XThe time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to
Xbe pressed when reading bound multi-character sequences.
X.TP
X.B LINES
XThe number of lines for this terminal session.
XUsed for printing select lists and for the line editor.
X.TP
X.B LISTMAX
XIn the line editor,
Xthe number of filenames to list without asking first.
XIf set to zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll

X.B LITHISTSIZE
XThe maximum size of the literal history list (before history expansion).
X.TP
X.B LOGCHECK
XThe interval in seconds between checks for login/logout activity
Xusing the \fBwatch\fP parameter.
X.TP
X.B MAIL
XIf this parameter is set and \fBmailpath\fP is not set,
Xthe shell looks for mail in the specified file.  By default it is set to
Xthe user's system mailbox.
X.TP
X.B MAILCHECK
XThe interval in seconds between checks for new mail. 
X.TP
X.B mailpath (MAILPATH)
XAn array (colon-separated list)
Xof filenames to check for new mail.  Each filename can
Xbe followed by a ? and a message that will be printed.
XThe sequence $_ in the message will be replaced by the name 
Xof the mail file.
XThe default message is "You have new mail." If an element is a directory
Xinstead of a file the shell will recursively check every file in every
Xsubdirectory of the element.
X.TP
X.B manpath (MANPATH)
XAn array (colon-separated list)
Xwhose value is not used by the shell.  The \fBmanpath\fP
Xarray can be useful, however, since setting it also sets
X\fBMANPATH\fP, and vice versa.
X.TP
X.B NULLCMD
XThe command name to assume if a redirection is specified
Xwith no command.  Defaults to \fBcat\fP.  For sh/ksh-like
Xbehavior, change this to \fB:\fP.  For csh-like
Xbehavior, unset this parameter; the shell will print an
Xerror message if null commands are entered.
X.TP
X.B path (PATH)
XAn array (colon-separated list)
Xof directories to search for commands.
XWhen this parameter is set, each directory is scanned
Xand all files found are put in a hash table.
X.TP
X.B POSTEDIT
XThis string is output whenever the line editor exits.
XIt usually contains termcap strings to reset the terminal.
X.TP
X.B PROMPT
XThe primary prompt string, printed before a command is read;
Xthe default is "%m%# ".  If the escape sequence takes an optional
Xinteger, it should appear between the '%' and the next character of the
Xsequence.  The following escape sequences are recognized:

Xrespectively.
X.TP
X.B psvar (PSVAR)
XAn array (colon-separated list) whose first nine values can be used in
X\fBPROMPT\fP strings.  Setting \fBpsvar\fP also sets \fBPSVAR\fP, and
Xvice versa.
X.TP
X.B prompt
XSame as \fBPROMPT\fP.
X.TP
X.B READNULLCMD
XThe command name to assume if a single input redirection
Xis specified with no command.  Defaults to \fBmore\fP.
X.TP
X.B REPORTTIME

Xcorrection, and \fB%r\fP expands to the proposed correction.
XAll other \fBPROMPT\fP escapes are also allowed.
X.TP
X.B STTY
XIf this parameter is set in a command's environment, the shell runs the
X\fBstty\fP command with the value of this parameter as arguments in order to
Xset up the terminal before executing the command. The modes apply only to the
Xcommand, and are reset when it finishes or is suspended. If the command is
Xsuspended and continued later with the \fBfg\fP or \fBwait\fP builtins it will
Xsee the modes specified by STTY, as if it were not suspended.  This
X(intentionally) does not apply if the command is continued via "kill -CONT".
XSTTY is ignored if the command is run in the background, or if it is in the
Xenvironment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in the input line. This
Xavoids running stty at every external command by accidentally exporting it.
XAlso note that STTY should not be used for window size specifications; these
Xwill not be local to the command.
X.TP
X.B TIMEFMT
XThe format of process time reports with the \fBtime\fP keyword.
XThe default is "%E real  %U user  %S system  %P %J".

Xoption. If this string is empty the first word in the range is taken
Xas the command name for which to complete. In this case, if the cursor
Xis in the first word, command names are completed.
XExample: `compctl -x 'r[-exec,;]' -l '' -- find' completes the

Xthe \fIflags\fP given before the \-\fBx\fP are used.  Note that each

Xquoted to prevent expansion of metacharacters by the shell. A \fIpattern\fP
Xis built of sub\-patterns separated by commas; it matches if at least one of 
Xthese sub\-patterns matches (they are `or'ed'). These sub\-patterns are in
Xturn composed of other sub\-patterns separated by white spaces which match
Xif all of the sub\-patterns match (they are `and'ed').
