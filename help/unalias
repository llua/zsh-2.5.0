       alias [ -grm ] [ name[=value] ] ...
              With no arguments, print the list of aliases in the
              form name=value on the standard output.   For  each
              name  with  a  corresponding value, define an alias
              with that value.  A trailing space in value  causes
              the next word to be checked for alias substitution.
              If the -g flag is present, define a  global  alias;
              global  aliases  are  expanded  even if they do not
              occur in command position.  For each name  with  no
              value,  print  the  value of name, if any.  If only
              the -g or the -r flags are  given  only  global  or
              regular aliases are listed. If the -m flag is given
              the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be
              quoted  to  preserve them from being interpreted as
              glob patterns) and the aliases matching these  pat-
              terns are printed.  The exit status is nonzero if a
              name (with no value) is given for  which  no  alias
              has been defined.

       unalias [ -m ] name ...
              The  alias  definition,  if  any,  for each name is
              removed.  With the -m flag the arguments are  taken
              as patterns (should be quoted) and all aliases with
              matching names are removed.
