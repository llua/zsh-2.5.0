       shift [ n ] [ name ... ]
              The positional parameters from $n+1 ... are renamed
              $1,  where  n  is  an  arithmetic  expression  that
              defaults to 1.  If any names  are  given  then  the
              arrays  with these names are shifted instead of the
              positional parameters.
