       disable [ -m ] arg ...
              Disable the builtin arg temporarily.   This  allows
              you  to  use an external command with the same name
              as a shell builtin.  Without arguments all disabled
              builtins  are  printed,  with the -m flag the argu-
              ments are taken as patterns (should  be  quoted  to
              preserve  them  from  being taken as glob patterns)
              and all builtins matching these patterns  are  dis-
              abled.   Actually the same as unhash.  Builtins can
              be enabled with the enable command.
