       setopt [ +-options ] [ name ... ]
              Set  the options for the shell.  All options speci-
              fied either with flags or by name are set.   If  no
              arguments  are  supplied,  the names of all options
              currently set are printed.  In option  names,  case
              is insignificant, and all underscore characters are
              ignored.  If the -m flag is given the arguments are
              taken  as  patterns  (should  be quoted to preserve
              them from being interpreted as glob  patterns)  and
              all  options with names matching these patterns are
              set.

       unsetopt [ +-options ] [ name ... ]
              Unset the options for the shell.  All options spec-
              ified either with flags or by name  are  unset.  If
              the  -m  flag is given the arguments are considered
              to be patterns (don't forget to quote them) and all
              options  with  names  matching  these  patterns are
              unset.

       The  following  options  may be set upon invocation of the
       shell, or with the set or setopt builtins. They  are  case
       insensitive  and underscores are ignored, that is, "allex-
       port" is equivalent to "A__lleXP_ort".
              ALL_EXPORT (-a)
                     All  parameters  subsequently  defined   are
                     automatically exported.
              ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT
                     If unset key functions that list completions
                     try to return to the last prompt if given  a
                     numeric argument. If set these functions try
                     to return to the last  prompt  if  given  no
                     numeric argument.
              ALWAYS_TO_END
                     If  a completion with the cursor in the word
                     was started  and  it  results  in  only  one
                     match,  the  cursor  is placed at the end of
                     the word.
              APPEND_HISTORY
                     If this is set,  zsh  sessions  will  append
                     their  history  list  to  the  history file,
                     rather than  overwrite  it.  Thus,  multiple
                     parallel  zsh  sessions  will all have their
                     history lists added to the history file,  in
                     the order they are killed.
              AUTO_CD (-J)
                     If  a  command is not in the hash table, and
                     there exists an executable directory by that
                     name,  perform the cd command to that direc-
                     tory.
              AUTO_LIST (-9)
                     Automatically list choices on  an  ambiguous
                     completion.
              AUTO_MENU
                     Automatically  use menu completion after the
                     second consecutive request  for  completion,
                     for  example by pressing the TAB key repeat-
                     edly.   This   option   is   overridden   by
                     MENU_COMPLETE.
              AUTO_PARAM_KEYS
                     If  a  parameter  name was completed and the
                     next character typed is one  of  those  that
                     have  to  come directly after the name (like
                     `}', `:', etc.) they are placed there  auto-
                     matically.
              AUTO_PUSHD (-N)
                     Make cd act like pushd.
              AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH
                     When  the  last  character  resulting from a
                     completion is a slash and the next character
                     typed is a word delimiter, remove the slash.
              AUTO_RESUME (-W)
                     Treat single word  simple  commands  without
                     redirection  as candidates for resumption of
                     an existing job.
              BGNICE (-6)
                     Run all background jobs at a lower priority.
                     This option is set by default.
              BRACE_CCL
                     Allow brace expansions of the form {a-zA-Z},
                     etc.
              CDABLE_VARS (-T)
                     If the argument  to  a  cd  command  (or  an
                     implied  cd  with the AUTO_CD option set) is
                     not a directory, and does not begin  with  a
                     slash, try to expand the expression as if it
                     were preceded by a ~ (see Filename Expansion
                     above).
              CHASE_LINKS (-w)
                     Resolve symbolic links to their true values.
              COMPLETE_ALIASES
                     If set aliases on the command line  are  not
                     internally  substituted before completion is
                     attempted.
              COMPLETE_IN_WORD
                     If unset the cursor is set to the end of the
                     word  if completion is started. Otherwise it
                     stays there and completion is done from both
                     ends.
              CORRECT (-0)
                     Try to correct the spelling of commands.
              CORRECT_ALL (-O)
                     Try to correct the spelling of all arguments
                     in a line.
              CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY
                     A history reference without an event  speci-
                     fier  will always refer to the previous com-
                     mand.
              CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS
                     Allow loop bodies to take  the  form  "list;
                     end" instead of "do list; done".
              CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES
                     Complain if a quoted expression runs off the
                     end of a line;  prevent  quoted  expressions
                     from containing unescaped newlines.
              CSH_JUNKIE_TILDE
                     Any  unquoted = and ~ resulting from parame-
                     ter  substitution  are  eligible  for   file
                     expansion.
              CSH_NULL_GLOB
                     If  a pattern for filename generation has no
                     matches, delete the pattern from  the  argu-
                     ment list; do not report an error unless all
                     the patterns in a command have  no  matches.
                     Overrides NULLGLOB.
              ERR_EXIT (-e)
                     If  a  command  has  a non-zero exit status,
                     execute the ZERR trap, if set, and exit.
              EXTENDED_GLOB
                     Treat the # and ^ characters as part of pat-
                     terns for filename generation, etc.
              EXTENDED_HISTORY
                     Save  beginning and ending timestamps to the
                     history file.  The format  of  these  times-
                     tamps     is    :<beginning    time>:<ending
                     time>:<command>.
              GLOB_COMPLETE
                     When the current word has a glob pattern, do
                     not  insert all the words resulting from the
                     expansion  but  cycle  through   them   like
                     MENU_COMPLETE.  If no matches are found, a *
                     is added to the end of the word or  inserted
                     at  the  cursor  if COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set,
                     and  expansion  is  attempted  again.  Using
                     patterns  works  not  only for files but for
                     all  completions,  such  as  options,   user
                     names, etc.
              GLOB_DOTS (-4)
                     Do  not require a leading . in a filename to
                     be matched explicitly.
              HASH_CMDS
                     Place the location of each  command  in  the
                     hash  table  the  first time it is executed.
                     If this option is  unset,  no  path  hashing
                     will be done at all.
              HASH_DIRS
                     Whenever  a  command  is  executed, hash the
                     directory containing  it,  as  well  as  all
                     directories  that occur earlier in the path.
                     Has no effect if HASH_CMDS is unset.
              HASH_LIST_ALL
                     Whenever a command completion is  attempted,
                     make  sure the entire command path is hashed
                     first.   This  makes  the  first  completion
                     slower.
              HIST_IGNORE_DUPS (-h)
                     Do  not enter command lines into the history
                     list if they are duplicates of the  previous
                     event.
              HIST_IGNORE_SPACE (-g)
                     Do  not enter command lines into the history
                     list if they begin with a blank.
              HIST_LIT (-j)
                     Use literal (unparsed) versions of the  his-
                     tory lines in the editor.
              HIST_NO_STORE
                     Remove  the history (fc -l) command from the
                     history when invoked.
              HIST_VERIFY
                     Whenever the user enters a line with history
                     substitution,   don't   execute   the   line
                     directly; instead, perform history substitu-
                     tion  and  reload  the line into the editing
                     buffer.
              IGNORE_BRACES (-I)
                     Do not perform brace expansion.
              IGNORE_EOF (-7)
                     Do not exit on end-of-file.  Require the use
                     of exit or logout instead.
              INTERACTIVE (-i)
                     This is an interactive shell.
              INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k)
                     Allow comments even in interactive shells.
              KSH_OPTION_PRINT
                     Alters the way options settings are printed.
              LIST_AMBIGUOUS
                     If this option is set completions are  shown
                     only   if   the  completions  don't  have  a
                     unambiguous prefix or suffix that  could  be
                     inserted in the command line.
              LIST_TYPES (-X)
                     When listing files that are possible comple-
                     tions, show the type of  each  file  with  a
                     trailing identifying mark.
              LOGIN (-l)
                     This is a login shell.
              LONG_LIST_JOBS (-R)
                     List jobs in the long format by default.
              MAIL_WARNING (-U)
                     Print  a  warning message if a mail file has
                     been accessed since the shell last  checked.
              MARK_DIRS (-8)
                     Append  a  trailing / to all directory names
                     resulting from  filename  generation  (glob-
                     bing).
              MENU_COMPLETE (-Y)
                     On an ambiguous completion, instead of list-
                     ing possibilities  or  beeping,  insert  the
                     first  match immediately.  Then when comple-
                     tion is requested again,  remove  the  first
                     match  and  insert  the  second  match, etc.
                     When there are no more matches, go  back  to
                     the  first one again.  reverse-menu-complete
                     may be used to loop through the list in  the
                     other   direction.   This  option  overrides
                     AUTO_MENU.
              MONITOR (-m)
                     Allow job control.  Set by default in inter-
                     active shells.
              NO_BAD_PATTERN (-2)
                     If  a  pattern  for  filename  generation is
                     badly formed,  leave  it  unchanged  in  the
                     argument  list instead of printing an error.
              NO_BANG_HIST (-K)
                     Do not perform textual history substitution.
                     Do not treat the ! character specially.
              NO_BEEP (-B)
                     Do not beep.
              NO_CLOBBER (-1)
                     Prevents   >   redirection  from  truncating
                     existing files.  >! may be used to  truncate
                     a  file instead.  Also prevents >> from cre-
                     ating files.  >>! may be used instead.
              NO_EQUALS
                     Don't perform = filename substitution.
              NO_EXEC (-n)
                     Read commands  and  check  them  for  syntax
                     errors, but do not execute them.
              NO_GLOB (-F)
                     Disable filename generation.
              NO_FLOW_CONTROL
                     Disable  output  flow control via start/stop
                     characters (usually assigned  to  ^S/^Q)  in
                     the shell's editor.
              NO_HIST_BEEP
                     Don't beep when an attempt is made to access
                     a history entry which isn't there.
              NO_HUP Don't send the HUP signal  to  running  jobs
                     when the shell exits.
              NO_LIST_BEEP
                     Don't beep on an ambiguous completion.
              NO_NOMATCH (-3)
                     If  a pattern for filename generation has no
                     matches, leave it unchanged in the  argument
                     list  instead  of  printing  an error.  This
                     also applies to file expansion of an initial
                     ~ or =.
              NO_PROMPT_CR (-V)
                     Don't  print  a  carriage return just before
                     printing a prompt in the line editor.
              NO_RCS (-f)
                     Source only the /etc/zshenv  file.   Do  not
                     source  the  .zshenv,  /etc/zprofile, .zpro-
                     file, /etc/zshrc, .zshrc, /etc/zlogin, .zlo-
                     gin, or .zlogout files.
              NO_SHORT_LOOPS
                     Disallow the short forms of for, select, if,
                     and function constructs.
              NOTIFY (-5)
                     Report the status of background jobs immedi-
                     ately, rather than waiting until just before
                     printing a prompt.
              NO_UNSET (-u)
                     Treat unset parameters as an error when sub-
                     stituting.
              NULL_GLOB (-G)
                     If  a pattern for filename generation has no
                     matches, delete the pattern from  the  argu-
                     ment  list  instead  of  reporting an error.
                     Overrides NO_NOMATCH.
              NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT
                     If numeric filenames are matched by a  file-
                     name  generation pattern, sort the filenames
                     numerically rather than lexicographically.
              OVER_STRIKE
                     Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.
              PATH_DIRS (-Q)
                     Perform  a path search even on command names
                     with   slashes    in    them.     Thus    if
                     "/usr/local/bin"  is in the user's path, and
                     he   types    "X11/xinit",    the    command
                     "/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit"  will be executed
                     (assuming it exists).  This applies to the .
                     builtin  as  well  as  to command execution.
                     Commands explicitly beginning with  "./"  or
                     "../" are not subject to path search.
              MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST
                     All  unquoted  arguments of the from identi-
                     fier=expression  have  file  expansion  per-
                     formed on expression as if it were a parame-
                     ter assignment, although the argument is not
                     otherwise treated specially.
              PRINT_EXIT_VALUE (-C)
                     Print  the  exit value of programs with non-
                     zero exit status.
              PROMPT_SUBST
                     If set expressions like ${...}, $(...),  and
                     $[...]  in prompts will be expanded.
              PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
                     Don't  push  multiple  copies  of  the  same
                     directory onto the directory stack.
              PUSHD_MINUS
                     See popd below.
              PUSHD_SILENT (-E)
                     Do not print the directory stack after pushd
                     or popd.
              PUSHD_TO_HOME (-D)
                     Have  pushd with no arguments act like pushd
                     $HOME.
              RC_EXPAND_PARAM (-P)
                     See Parameter Expansion.
              RC_QUOTES
                     Allow the character sequence '' to signify a
                     single quote within singly quoted strings.
              REC_EXACT (-S)
                     In  completion, recognize exact matches even
                     if they are ambiguous.
              RM_STAR_SILENT (-H)
                     Do not query the user before  executing  "rm
                     *" or "rm path/*".
              SHIN_STDIN (-s)
                     Read commands from the standard input.
              SH_WORD_SPLIT (-y)
                     See Parameter Expansion.
              SINGLE_LINE_ZLE (-M)
                     Use single-line command line editing instead
                     of multi-line.
              SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK (-L)
                     If a line ends with a backquote,  and  there
                     are an odd number of backquotes on the line,
                     ignore the trailing backquote.  This is use-
                     ful  on  some keyboards where the return key
                     is too small, and  the  backquote  key  lies
                     annoyingly close to it.
              VERBOSE (-v)
                     Print shell input lines as they are read.
              XTRACE (-x)
                     Print  commands  and their arguments as they
                     are executed.
              ZLE (-Z)
                     Use the zsh line editor.
