       enable [ -m ] arg ...
              Enable  the  specified builtin commands, presumably
              disabled earlier with disable.   Without  arguments
              the  enabled  builtins  are printed and with the -m
              flag the arguments are taken as patterns (should be
              quoted)  and  all  builtins matching these patterns
              are enabled.
