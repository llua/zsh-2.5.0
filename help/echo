       echo [ -n ] [ arg ... ]
              Write each arg on the standard output, with a space
              separating each one.  If the -n flag  is  not  pre-
              sent,  print a newline at the end.  echo recognizes
              the following escape sequences:
              \a     bell character
              \b     backspace
              \c     don't print an ending newline
              \e     escape
              \f     form feed
              \n     newline
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \\     backslash
              \nnn   character code in octal, with a  maximum  of
                     four  digits.  A  non-octal digit terminates
                     the number. It must start with zero.
