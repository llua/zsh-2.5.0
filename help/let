       let arg ...
              Evaluate each arg as an arithmetic expression.  See
              ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above for  a  description  of
              arithmetic  expressions.   The  exit status is 0 if
              the value of the last expression is nonzero, and  1
              otherwise.
