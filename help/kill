       kill [ -sig ] job ...
       kill -l
              Sends either SIGTERM or the specified signal to the
              given jobs or processes.  Signals are given by num-
              ber or by names (with the  prefix  "SIG"  removed).
              If  the signal being sent is not KILL or CONT, then
              the job will  be  sent  a  CONT  signal  if  it  is
              stopped.  The argument job can be the process id of
              a job not in the job list.   In  the  second  form,
              kill -l, the signal names are listed.
