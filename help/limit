       limit [ -h ] [ resource [ limit ] ] ...
       limit -s
              Limit the resource consumption of the current shell
              and its children.  If limit is not specified, print
              the current limit placed on resource; otherwise set
              the limit to the specified value.  If the  -h  flag
              is  given,  use hard limits instead of soft limits.
              If no resource is given, print all limits.

              resource is one of:

              cputime
                     Maximum CPU seconds per process.
              filesize
                     Largest single file allowed.
              datasize
                     Maximum data size (including stack) for each
                     process.
              stacksize
                     Maximum stack size for each process.
              coredumpsize
                     Maximum size of a core dump.
              resident
                     Maximum resident set size.
              memoryuse
                     The same as resident.
              memorylocked
                     Maximum amount of memory locked in RAM.
              descriptors
                     Maximum value for a file descriptor.
              openfiles
                     Maximum number of open files.
              vmemorysize
                     Maximum amount of virtual memory.

              Which   of  these  resource  limits  are  available
              depends on the system.  limit is a number, with  an
              optional scaling factor, as follows:

              nh     hours.
              nk     kilobytes.   This is the default for all but
                     cputime.
              nm     megabytes or minutes.
              mm:ss  minutes and seconds.
