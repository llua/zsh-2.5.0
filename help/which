              search for name even if it  is  a  shell  function,
              alias,  or  reserved  word.  The -c flag prints the
              results in a csh-like format.  The -a flag  does  a
              search  for  all occurrences of name throughout the
              command path.  With the -m flag the  arguments  are
              taken as patterns (should be quoted) and the infor-

              of these patterns.
