              for name [ in word ... ]
              do list
              done   Expand the list of words, and set the param-
                     eter name to each of them in turn, executing
                     list each time.  If the in word is  omitted,
                     use the positional parameters instead of the
                     words.

              for name [ in word ... ] ; sublist
                     This is a shorthand for for.  Though it  may
                     cause  confusion,  it is included for conve-
                     nience; its use in scripts  is  discouraged,
                     unless  sublist  is  a command of the form {
                     list }.

              foreach name ( word ... )
              list
              end    Another form of for.
