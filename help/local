              Set  attributes  and  values  for shell parameters.
              When invoked inside a function a new  parameter  is
              created  which will be unset when the function com-
              pletes.  The new parameter  will  not  be  exported
              unless  ALLEXPORT is set, in which case the parame-
              ter will be exported provided no parameter of  that
              name  already exists.  The following attributes are
              valid:
              -L     Left justify and remove leading blanks  from
                     value.   If  n  is  nonzero,  it defines the
                     width of the field; otherwise it  is  deter-
                     mined by the width of the value of the first
                     assignment.  When the parameter is  printed,
                     it  is  filled  on  the right with blanks or
                     truncated if necessary  to  fit  the  field.
                     Leading  zeros are removed if the -Z flag is
                     also set.
              -R     Right justify and fill with leading  blanks.
                     If  n is nonzero if defines the width of the
                     field; otherwise it  is  determined  by  the
                     width  of the value of the first assignment.
                     When the parameter is printed, the field  is
                     left  filled  with  blanks or truncated from
                     the end.
              -Z     Right justify and fill with leading zeros if
                     the first non-blank character is a digit and
                     the -L flag has  not  been  set.   If  n  is
                     nonzero  it  defines the width of the field;
                     otherwise it is determined by the  width  of
                     the value of the first assignment.
              -f     The  names  refer  to  functions rather than
                     parameters.  No assignments can be made, and
                     the  only  other  valid flags are -t and -u.
                     The flag -t turns on execution  tracing  for
                     this  function.   The  flag  -u  causes this
                     function to be marked for autoloading.   The
                     fpath parameter will be searched to find the
                     function definition  when  the  function  is
                     first referenced.
              -i     Use  an internal integer representation.  If
                     n is nonzero it defines  the  output  arith-
                     metic  base,  otherwise  it is determined by
                     the first assignment.
              -l     Convert to lower case.
              -r     The given names are marked readonly.
              -t     Tags the named  parameters.   Tags  have  no
                     special meaning to the shell.
              -u     Convert to upper case.
              -x     Mark for automatic export to the environment
                     of subsequently executed commands.

              Using + rather than - causes these flags to be
              turned off.
              If no arguments are given but flags are  specified,
              a  list  of named parameters which have these flags
              set is printed.  Using + instead of -  keeps  their
              values  from  being  printed.   If  no arguments or
              options are given, the names and attributes of  all
              parameters  are  printed.  If  only  the -m flag is
              given the arguments are taken as  patterns  (should
              be  quoted)  and  all parameters or functions (with
              the -f flag) with matching names are printed.
