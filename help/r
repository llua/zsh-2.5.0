       fc [ -e ename ] [ -nlrdDfEm ] [ old=new ... ] [ first [
              last ] ]
       fc -ARWI [ filename ]
              Select  a range of commands from first to last from
              the history list.  The arguments first and last may
              be  specified  as a number or as a string.  A nega-
              tive number is used as an  offset  to  the  current
              history  event number.  A string specifies the most
              recent event beginning with the given string.   All
              substitutions  old=new,  if any, are then performed
              on the commands.  If the  -l  flag  is  given,  the
              resulting  commands  are listed on standard output.
              If the -m flag is also given the first argument  is
              taken  as a pattern (should be quoted) and only the
              history events matching this pattern will be shown.
              Otherwise  the editor program ename is invoked on a
              file containing these history events.  If ename  is
              not  given,  the  value  of the parameter FCEDIT is
              used.  If ename is "-", no editor is invoked.  When
              editing  is complete, the edited command(s) is exe-
              cuted.  If first is not specified, it will  be  set
              to  -1 (the most recent event), or to -16 if the -l
              flag is given.  If last is not specified,  it  will
              be  set to first, or to -1 if the -l flag is given.
              The flag -r reverses the order of the commands  and
              the  flag  -n suppresses command numbers when list-
              ing.  Also when listing, -d prints  timestamps  for
              each  command, and -f prints full time-date stamps.
              Adding the -E flag causes the dates to  be  printed
              as  `dd.mm.yyyy'.   With  the  -D  flag,  fc prints
              elapsed times.

              fc -R reads the history from the given file, fc  -W
              writes the history out to the given file, and fc -A
              appends the history out to the given file.  fc  -AI
              (-WI)  appends  (writes) only those events that are
              new since last incremental append  (write)  to  the
              history  file.  In  any  case the file will have no
              more than SAVEHIST entries.
