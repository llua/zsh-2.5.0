       dirs [ -v ] [ arg ... ]
              With no arguments, print the contents of the direc-
              tory stack.  If the -v option is given, number  the
              directories  in  the stack when printing.  Directo-
              ries are added to this stack with  the  pushd  com-
              mand, and removed with the cd or popd commands.  If
              arguments are specified, load them onto the  direc-
              tory  stack, replacing anything that was there, and
              push the current directory onto the stack.
