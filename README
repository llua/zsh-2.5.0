This is zsh version 2.5.0.  Zsh is a shell with lots of features.  For
a list of these, see the FEATURES file.  For more details, see the
documentation.


Installing zsh
--------------
To compile zsh, cd into the src directory and type "./buildzsh".  The
buildzsh script takes various options that are useful if you want to
use a nonstandard compiler, build on several architectures, etc.  Do a
"./buildzsh help" for details.  If no errors occur, you can install
zsh by typing "make install".  This will install the executable and
the manpage.

The compilation procedure has recently been tested and found to work
on the machines listed below.  It might work on others, too,
particularly if they're small variations of these.  If so, please tell
us about it.

SunOS 4.1.1 and 4.1.3
SunOS 5.1 and 5.2
Solaris 2.3
Linux (various versions), but can't use USE_ZSH_MALLOC
AIX 3.2
HP9000/700, after manually telling buildzsh to use setpgid
HP9000/827, but only with GCC
HP9000/847
HPUX 9.04
NeXT with NS3.0 and NS3.1
IRIX 5.1.1.1 and 5.2
Alpha with OSF/1 1.2, 1.3 and 2.0
Alpha with Ultrix (unspecified)
DECstation with Ultrix (unspecified)
DECstation 5000/240 with Ultrix 4.2A
DECstation 5000/25 with Mach 3.0
NetBSD 0.9b
DYNIX/ptx 1.4 and 2.0.4 with X11
Sony NWS with NEWS-OS 3.3
Mac with MiNT after redefining the zgetwd() function as getwd()

If you have used zsh before, please be sure to read the section
"Important changes" below.

Included in this release are alternative malloc and associated
functions which reduce memory usage on some systems.  You can use
these by defining USE_ZSH_MALLOC in config.h.


Documentation
-------------
There are a number of documents about zsh in this distribution:

man/zsh.1	A manpage in nroff format.  This will be installed in
		/usr/man/man1 by "make install".

doc/intro.ms	An introduction to zsh in troff format using the ms
		macros.  This document explains many of the features
		that make zsh more equal than other shells.

doc/zsh.texi	Everything the manpage has, but in texinfo format.

If you do not have the necessary tools to process these documents,
postscript, ascii and info versions are available in a separate file
at the distribution sites:

carlo.phys.uva.nl:/pub/bas/zsh/zsh-2.5.0doc.tar.gz
ftp.sterling.com:/zsh/zsh-2.5.0doc.tar.gz

The distribution also contains a help directory with descriptions of
builtin commands taken from the manpage.  The example function
func/run-help will view the appropriate file from the help directory,
set in the HELPDIR variable, or run 'man' if such a file is not
available.


Important changes
-----------------
This is a list of changes in zsh compared to version 2.3.1 which might
force you to change your old initialization files.

The -h option to compctl for host completion no longer exists.  Define
a hosts variable and use compctl -k hosts instead.  Example: change
compctl -h ping
to
compctl -k hosts ping

The hostcmds, bindcmds, optcmds and varcmds special arrays no longer
exist.  Use compctl -k hosts, -b, -o and -v respectively.

The NO_UNSET option applies to the positional parameters (usually the
arguments to a script) as well as to all other parameters.

There is a new option CSH_JUNKIE_PAREN which has to be set to allow
the csh-syntax "if (test) { foo }" to work.  This has been done to
enhance sh compatibility, where "if (test)" might be used to run
"test" in a subshell.
